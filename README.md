# EarthAnnotator

> Rapid image labeling for data-driven Earth science discovery.

A tool for web-based image annotation and efficient labeling pixels in images. 

Implements a rapid technique, described by [Buscombe & Ritchie, (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/8/7/244), for dense image labeling based on limited manual annotations.
